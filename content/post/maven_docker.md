**[TL;DR]**

Lorem ipsum

This is the first post of this blog.

It is the place where I plan to store notes about my various experimentations,
explorations and discoveries. These notes are mainly for myself. Writing is a way for me
to structure what I learned. And by the way, it is a good way to stop worrying about forgetting.

If you, passer-by, can also learn something with this, I would be doubly rewarded.
