Begin November, I gave a Docker one-day training at the Science Faculty of the Aix-Marseille University (Marseille - Luminy). Somehow, we failed to have the evaluation forms filled in at the end of the day. As the Training Dept. required these forms, we had to find an alternate solution that would work for the people that had to leave the training in a hurry. 

Somebody suggested "Lime Survey". I didn't know that tool but it seemed quite popular in the scientific community. Google Forms would certainly have made the trick but as I am curious, I wanted to give Lime Survey a shot.

Like Wordpress, there is a hosted offer with a free/demo option. I wasn't able to make it work. I somehow mixed-up the registration.

I quickly jumped to the "Plan B": setup my own instance. Especially as I saw that good looking Docker images were available.

Tried to register on the test instance. somehow failed.

plan B, install an instance
