A **shack** is a type of small, often primitive shelter or dwelling. It can also refer to a small holiday house with limited conveniences, for instance it may not have running water or electricity.

This "Internet Shack" is the perfect place for random experiments that bother nobody.

The ongoing explorations relate to linux configuration with Ansible, Docker, Hugo static site generator and Gogs Git self hosting.

I have called this place "the captain's shack" because of my alleged ressemblance to the advertising mascot for the Birds Eye frozen food brand. While known in the english speaking world as "[Captain Birdseye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Birdseye)", french speakers know him as "[Captain Iglo](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Iglo)".

I let you judge by yourself.
